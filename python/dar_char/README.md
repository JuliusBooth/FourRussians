-t", block of size t x t (default = 4)  

-b", penalty for removing or inserting block (default = -1), will be automatically multiplied by t

-s, Scoring for a match (default = 2)

-m, Penalty for mismatching (default = -1)

-p, Penalty for gap (default = -1)

Run
```
python FourRussians.py
```
and follow instructions

Uses Four Russians method to speed up global alignment by pre-calculating the matching score of 4^t x 4^t sized nucleotides in a look-up table (LUT). The LUT can then be used to find the score in log n time when calculating the dynamic programming matrix.

Current progress/ideas/comments:
-created LUT but only for nucleotides of lowercase (e.g can't use AAAA, only aaaa)  
-seems to work, but not sure if calculating block sizes correctly, and if time improvement is seen
